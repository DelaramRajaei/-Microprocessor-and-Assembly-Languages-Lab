## Project 1: Safe Password Setter and Verifier

### Description:
This project is developed using Arduino IDE and Proteus Design Suite. It allows users to set a password for a safe, change it as needed, and verify the entered password. The safe password can be easily updated through the Arduino interface, and the system ensures that only authorized users can access the safe.

## Project 2: Voting System

### Description:
The voting system project, developed using Arduino IDE and Proteus Design Suite, facilitates the voting process by allowing people to cast their votes securely. Each candidate has a designated button, and when pressed, the vote is recorded and tallied. The system keeps track of the votes for each candidate, ensuring an accurate count, and updates the tally in real-time.

## Project 3: Vending Machine

### Description:
In this project, created with Arduino IDE and Proteus Design Suite, a vending machine is simulated. Each item in the vending machine is assigned a unique number, and users can select their desired item by entering its corresponding number. The system then maps the client's order with the item to be purchased, ensuring accurate delivery and transaction management.

### Installation and Usage:
1. Download the Arduino IDE and Proteus Design Suite.
2. Open the respective project files in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board.
4. Simulate the project using Proteus Design Suite.
5. Follow on-screen instructions for interacting with each project.

### Notes:
- Ensure that all components are properly connected in the Proteus simulation to accurately test the projects.
- Refer to the code comments for detailed explanations of the functionality and implementation of each project.
- Customize the projects as needed to fit specific requirements or expand functionality.
